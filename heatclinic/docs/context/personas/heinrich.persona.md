# Persona "Heinrich"

![Foto von Heinrich](./images/heinrich.jpg)

* Age: 57  
* Nationality: Swiss  
* Profession: works in an office.

Heinrich loves spicy dishes. And he really does experiment with spices. Ever tried spicy candy or even spicy cookies? You can get that at Heinrich's. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. Many dishes get refined with chutney, mustard fruits and more. An all time classic of Heinrich is noodle casserole with apple puree and a very very hot mango chutney to refine the lot, or raclette with mustard fruits. All in all, Heinrich is ready to try new and exotic stuff (spicy or not) and got his personal (and surprisingly tasty) favorites.
Given Heinrich's tastes. Family and friends often bring, what they think hot sauce. Usually they proved to be not that hot at all. 
However, Heinrich is not the thrill-seeker type who wants to brag about his ability to eat even the most devilish dishes. He's more the type who wants to eat great dishes and these dishes happens to be, in his case, spicier than most others would like them. Somewhere in the league of spicy indian dishes.


## Preferences and online buying behaviour 

**Loves to eat very spicy.**  
"The stuff you get in our stores is just like water, no spice to it."

**Loves to experiment with his dishes.**  
"Ever tried chocolate with mustard? real great with a good mustard."

**Prefers real shops to web shops.**  
"You can feel and taste it. In a web shop, you just buy a picture. Usually the products don't hold the promise."

**Finds the web shop by word of mouth only.**  
"I'm don't really search the internet for new stuff. I know my sites, sometimes I use google, but not with too much success. Most of the sites I visit I got from friends and family."

**Sauces are gifts from family and friends**  
"As everybody knows about my peculiarity with spicy sauces, many bring spicy stuff from their travels. Sometimes there is really great stuff I would want to order again, if I just knew how and where from."


## User Journey
1. Heinrich got to know our store by sheer accident. His daughter, when browsing the internet for something to add to the birthday table, spotted the site and ordered one sauce.
2. The sauce proofed to be an excellent ingredient for the veal roast.
3. When half a year later, the sauce was used up, Heinrich asked his daughter where she got it from. She went back to the internet, and after some searching found the site and mailed him the link.
4. Heinrich came to the site and started exploring. Finally he not only ordered the first sauce but also two other sauces that looked promising to him.
5. Being a creative type, again half a year later, Heinrich perfected his veal roast and sent an email to us, if we wouldn't want to share his recipe on our website. It was really a family success, he wrote.
6. For the last two years, in approximately 6 month interval, Heinrich ordered sauces from us. He has two favorite sauces and then adds the one or the other sauces just to try. 
7. After twice ordering the same sauce, Heinrich didn't like at all, he started making a list on which sauces not to buy anymore.
8. Our last specials with "exotic and spicy" actually caught his attention and he ordered one of each of them. We then approached him (together with a few others) and asked for feedback to the sauces and got quite a detailed account on the performance of each sauce and how he likes to combined them.
