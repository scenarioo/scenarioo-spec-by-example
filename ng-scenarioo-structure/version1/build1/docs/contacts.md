This list should help to find quickly a contact for a special know how area. It also helps to identify quickly in which area we have enough contributors with know how and where we should try to do more know how transfer during our work.



## Alumni Contributors

These are the former contributors that have left the team, with their most important know how areas. Just to remember all contributors that gave valuable input, in case to contact them for later questions and also to know who to invite for any "Project Success Event" ;-)
